This five-day hands-on workshop is primarily based on the book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). However, there are several other additional free and open source resources available for some of the individual packages we will cover.


## Data Science

### R for Data Science

This book is published by [O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1469550189&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+data+science&linkCode=sl1&tag=devtools-20&linkId=6fe0069f9605cf847ed96c191f4e84dd).

### Hands-On Pogramming with R

Like this workshop, this book is focused on applied uses of R for data science. However, this book focuses much more heavily on the programming aspects of R (i.e., there is no visualization or modeling). Programming is a crucial part of being a data scientist, which is not covered in depth in this workshop. Therefore, this book is a great next step for those looking to continue developing their data science skills in R after this workshop.

This book is published by [O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Programming-Write-Functions-Simulations/dp/1449359019). The online version of this book is free to read [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) (thanks to O'Reilly), and licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) License.

### Statistical Inference via Data Science: A moderndive Into R & the tidyverse

A whole course could be dedicated to statistical inference and modeling with R. That course should be built around the moderndive book. This book provides a fresh perspective on statistical inference including sampling variablity, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. All of this is done in the **tidyverse** ecosystem, and so could be dropped right into your normal **tidyverse** workflow of data analysis.

This book is in press, to be published in Fall 2019 by CRC Press. The online version of this book is free to read [here](https://moderndive.com) (thanks to Chapman & Hall/CRC), and licensed under the [Creative Commons 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) License.

## R Programming

### Advanced R

Unlike this workshop, which focused on applied uses of R and the **tidyverse** packages, this book takes a deep dive into how the R language works, and how to program with it to make your own tools. This is a must read for anyone who wants to develop their programming skills and become an R developer.

### R Packages

In this workshop we used packages that were developed by others, and we then we learned how to write our own functions. However, if you find that you are writing the same functions repeatedly, you should considered building your own R package so you can easy load your commmonly used functions. This books describes all of the necessary pieces of an R package, and walks through how to wrap your functions into a package and make it available for others to use also.

## Data Visualization

### Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction

This is an excellent introduction into the ideas and methods for data visualization using **ggplot2**. The book discusses not only how to make different types of visualizations, but to make them *well*. This includes discussion about best and worst practices, what chart types are appropriate for different kinds of data, and how to turn a visualization into a story that can be easily interpreted.

### R Graphics Cookbook

This book provides quick recipes to solve many common problems and questions that come up when making data visualizations in R. If you are looking for a quick answer without digging through all of the documentation for **ggplot2**, this is a good place to start looking!

This book is published by [O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491978600). The online version of this book is free to read [here](https://r-graphics.org) (thanks to O'Reilly).

### Fundamentals of Data Visualization

This book doesn't contain any code, but provides excellent discussion and advice for how to design attractive and informative graphics. The book covers a wide range of topics including which plot types are best for different data types, how to pick a color scheme, and how to visualizing uncertainty. Although no code is included in the book, it was written with **bookdown**, and the source code (including code to make the images) in available on [GitHub](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz).

This book is published by [O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492031089).
