Thank you for participating in the Tidy Data Science workshop! Here you'll find links to all of the materials that we will use throughout the week. In the bar on the left, you'll find links to download the course materials, as well as a link to the recordings of each sessions, which will be posted after each day. Finally, I've included some links to additional resources that may be useful for supplementing the material covered in this workshop and moving beyond what you will learn during the week.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to [contact](/#contact) us!
